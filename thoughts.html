        <h3>EMNLP 2025</h3>
        <p>Back from Suzhou, China for EMNLP 2025. Overall experience: quite good. Photo from Tongli water town included below. Yet, some thing has been bothering me ethically
		for quite some time. Given that AI is still not in place to provide live interpretation, isn't the value of English still there? It is a required skill for
		most higher education level and yet in China it was very often the case that researchers refused to present their work in English and that they would do it only in Chinese. My question then is,
		isn't this some form of gatekeeping. I think we are all acknowledge the English became the lingua franca with not the most fair and transparent way, but a lingua franca allows exactly 
		the fullfillment of the purpose of conferences. Deniying that, is denying the purpose of the conference. </p>
