        <h3>EMNLP 2025</h3>
        <p>Back from Suzhou, China, where I attended EMNLP 2025. Overall experience: quite good. 
		A photo from Tongli Water Town is included below. Despite the beautiful contrastive scenery (skyscrapers vs. ancient canals), 
		there is something that has been scratching my ethical ego since my colleagues and I returned.
		Given that AI is not yet able to provide live interpreting services, there is still value in a lingua franca, 
		isn't there? It is a required skill for most higher education levels, yet in China, it was often the case that researchers 
		refused to present their work in English and chose to do so only in Chinese. My question then is: isn't this some form of gatekeeping?
		I think we all acknowledge that English became the lingua franca in a way that was neither entirely fair nor transparent, but a lingua franca
		allows exactly the fulfillment of the purpose of conferences. Denying that is denying the purpose of any international conference. </p>
